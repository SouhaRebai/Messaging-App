# Messaging-App developed with reactJS and node.js.
My very first app that involves using a messaging service and Twilio SMS notification, I also included a full report (in french) that details steps I completed to develop and deploy 
this project that I used so I can provide a messaging plateform for my University [messagerie-IssatSo].

-- heroku and netlify links may be expired due to inactivity on the website, streamchat.io also requires monthly payments so if you have any suggestions on what free 
messaging service I could use,so i can keep the website runnig, I'll be more than happy to receive your suggestions :)
